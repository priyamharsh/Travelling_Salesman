## Travelling_Salesman
An attemp to solve the Travelling Salesman problem using the concept of Artificial Neural networks. The concept of Self organizing maps is used to solve the problem.
Here, a linear topology of SOM is considered where the last neuron is connected to the first neuron. The neurons will act like an elastic band and try to model the path
with the least distance through all the cities.
